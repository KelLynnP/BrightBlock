# BrightBlock
Code developed for Bright block project!

#Hardware Compatibility Based on files!

# First there is Golden Gate!

This is the first software developed for Bright Block which is compatible with Transmitting to the BLEEP App! 

The compatible hardware for this set up is as follows:

Sensors:

BME688, ICM20948, and PLANTTOWER all connected via I2C

GPS Wing sensor for GPS data, connected via the RX and TX pins

Setup is standard as per individual Adafruit + Chip documentation. 


# Second file is Twin Peaks!

This is the second implementation of the C++ code which can communicate with the Bleep App:

Here is the hardware stack:

Sensors:

Sensioron All in One SEN55, Ideally ICM20948 all connected via I2C

GPS Wing sensor for GPS data, connected via the RX and TX pins

Micro SD breakout board for saving memory to, connected to pin 27

Setup is standard as per individual Adaftuit + Sensiron Docs!
